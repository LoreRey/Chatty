# Chatty

A real-time chat app that allows users to send and receive messages/notifications, change their username, and view the number of online users. Built using React, Node, Webpack and Babel.

## Screenshots

When users join the chat room, a notification is sent that a 'user has joined' and/or has changed their username. User count on nav bar dictates the number of users online. Also, username colours are generated for every user.
